# CS106A - Lecture 8 - Strings & Grids


# Strings
# - Characters are divided into character classes:
# - - Alphabetic: 'a' 'z' used to make words
# - - Digits: '0' '1' '9' used to make numbers
# - - Space: space, tab, newline, "whitespace"


# Program Structure
# - Divide and conquer, divide program into many functions.


# Function Doctests
# - Doctests are the Python technology for easily testing a function.
# - >>> digits_only('Hi4!x3)
# - Looks like a function call, input between parens.
# - Write two or three Doctests first, before writing code.
# - First can be obvious, then add "edge" case test. 
# - Doctests enable writing little tests for each black-box function as you go, which turns out to be a big productivity booster.
