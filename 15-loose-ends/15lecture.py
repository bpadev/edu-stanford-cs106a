# CS106A - Lecture 15 - Loose Ends, Data Parsing


# Data Parsing
# - Have "raw" text and find and pull data you want.


# Loops
# - use for i/range for the case where you know the numbers ahead of time.
# - The while is more flexible, it can test on each iteration, stop at the right spot. 


# Variables
# - The variable name is just the label applied to the box that holds the pointer.
