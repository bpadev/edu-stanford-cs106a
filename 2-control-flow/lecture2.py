# CS106A - Lecture 2 - Control Flow


# Basics
# - Starts with more basic examples of the bit topic.
# - Indentation in Python is crucial.
# - Generality, code should work for all different input worlds. (general procedures from SICP)
# - Talks about infinite loops and how booleans control the while loops.


# Control Flow (If Statements)
if test-expression:
  ...
  ...
  ...
# - If expression returns true boolean, the code in the body will execute.
# - Python has a special value None which means "nothing".
# - Python uses == to compare values.
if x == 4:
  ...
  ...
  ...
# - Python uses != for not equal.
if x != 4:
  ...
  ...
  ...


# Important Ideas - Thinking Drawing and Coding
# - Don't do it in your head.
# - Make a Drawing / Sketch
# - What is a next-step goal?
# - What code could advance things to the next goal?
# - you need to spell it out simple for the computer, it does not know what you mean if you don't.
