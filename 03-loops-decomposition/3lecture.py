# CS106A - Lecture 3 - Loops & Decomposition


# Decomposition - Program and Functions
# - "Divide and Conquer", a classic strategy, works very well with computer code.
# - Divide a program into functions, each of manageable size.
# - Object oriented code, you call functions a little different.
bit.left()
# - "By name" form
go_west(bit)


# - Function Pre / Post Conditions
# - Pre - precondition of function state of world required before it runs.
# - Post - postcondition after it runs state of world promised after it's finished. 
# - Pre / Post make the "contract" of function - what it does, what it gets to assume when it is called, what it promises to provide.
