# Variables
# - A Python variable has a name and stores a value.
x = 42
# - Think of the variable as a little box, labeled with the variable's name, containing a pointer to the value stored.


# More About Python

# - Digital images are made of small square "pixels", "picture element".
# - The color of a pixel is very often encoded as RGB.

# - Origin is (0, 0) but is in the upper left.
# - X grows right, Y grows down.
# - Foreach loop runs over the image pixels.
